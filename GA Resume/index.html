			<h2 class="heading">Objective</h2>
			<p class="copy">To advance my career in B2B marketing using web development skills to give an online voice to businesses. And probably eventually start a consulting business of my own that will allow me free time to pursue other creative passions and spend more time petting dogs.</p>
			<h2 class="heading">Looking into a crystal ball...</h2>
			<p class="copy">I am taking this class because I saw an opportunity to fill a skills gap at my company and I could never afford to pay for this on my own. As a mentor once said to me, "If you don't ask, you don't get." Proficiency in these skills will open more doors for me within my company and will mean I am more marketable as a...marketer.</p>
